# LLM Security Evaluation Framework

A comprehensive framework for evaluating and benchmarking security in Large Language Models.

## Overview

This repository provides standardized methodologies and evaluation tools to help organizations assess and strengthen their LLM security measures. The framework focuses on systematic testing across multiple dimensions of model behavior.

## Key Components

### Evaluation Methodology
- Standardized test suites across multiple domains
- Reproducible benchmarking procedures
- Quantitative metrics for security assessment
- Comparative analysis capabilities

### Benchmark Categories

1. **Input Processing Assessment**
   - Standardized query validation
   - Edge case detection
   - Input variation handling
   - Domain-specific boundary testing

2. **Response Pattern Analysis**
   - Output consistency evaluation
   - Response variation measurement
   - Confidence threshold testing
   - Pattern recognition techniques

3. **Configuration Testing**
   - Parameter influence mapping
   - Setting optimization evaluation
   - Configuration boundary assessment
   - Operational mode analysis

4. **Cross-Model Evaluation**
   - Comparative security profiling
   - Standardized benchmark alignment
   - Transfer validation techniques
   - Deployment-specific assessments

## Metrics Framework

Our framework implements a multi-level evaluation system:

| Level | Description | Application |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| L1 | Basic compliance | Fundamental security assessment |
| L2 | Enhanced verification | Intermediate security evaluation |
| L3 | Comprehensive analysis | Advanced security profiling |
| L4 | Edge case exploration | Expert-level security research |

## Implementation Guide

```python
from llm_security import Evaluator

# Initialize evaluator
evaluator = Evaluator()

# Run standard assessment
results = evaluator.run_assessment(
    model="your-model",
    level=2,  # L2 evaluation level
    domains=["general", "specialized"]
)

# Generate comprehensive security report
report = evaluator.generate_report(results)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Testing Methodology**
   - Implement systematic testing protocols
   - Maintain consistent evaluation environments
   - Document all testing procedures
   - Apply standardized scoring systems

2. **Security Enhancement**
   - Establish baseline security measurements
   - Implement regular evaluation cycles
   - Create model-specific testing profiles
   - Develop integrated improvement workflows

3. **Documentation Standards**
   - Maintain detailed assessment records
   - Create standardized reporting templates
   - Implement consistent metrics tracking
   - Establish clear evaluation criteria

## Research Applications

- Security posture assessment
- Model robustness evaluation
- Development of enhanced protection mechanisms
- Comparative security analysis

## Running Tests with Real APIs

To run tests with real APIs (e.g., Anthropic Claude), set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
python test_outputs/anthropic_test.py
```

View the generated results and visualizations in:
- `test_outputs/results/` - JSON test results
- `test_outputs/visualizations/` - Performance charts
